            <p><b>Bachgound</b>: A common challenge that blockchain technologies need to tackle is scalability. Existing blockchain systems generally have high latency and can only have tens of transactions per second, whereas credit card companies such as Mastercard or Visa carry out thousands of transactions per second. One prominent solution to scalability for blockchains is to run many chains in parallel, often called sharding.</p>

            <p>In the last decade, multiple blockchain protocols targeting different use cases and relying on a multitude of technologies have emerged. The majority of them are not compatible and cannot interoperate, which poses the risk of isolation, fragmentation of services, and eventually failure for end-user adoption.</p>

            <p>This weakness contributes to other shortcomings of the decentralized web, such as scalability, and makes it impossible to provide a usable alternative to the centralized web, even in a setting where trusted third parties are obvious security holes.</p>

            <p>During the last couple of years, the community has realized this challenge and is set to enable interaction between different chains through building interoperability mechanisms.</p>
